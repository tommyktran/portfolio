        <h1>Hi! I'm Tommy Tran.</h1>
        <p>I'm an aspiring coder specializing in web development. Although I am most familiar working with vanilla <span class="emphasis">HTML, CSS, and JS,</span> I have also worked with <span class="emphasis">Node.js</span> and <span class="emphasis">C#</span>.</p>
        <p>My other interests include chess and creative writing. I also really like to make games from HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
        <p>I'm interested in technology because I enjoy solving problems and coming up with solutions using logical thinking or out-of-the-box creativity. Besides that, I also enjoy learning new skills, which programmers are always doing.</p>
        <p>I have graduated from Code Louisville's Front End course. Much of my coding knowledge was learned in Code Louisville or on my own, while I was making a personal project.</p>
